Exercise #1: Closures - Check number
Create a folder in class-7 called exercise-1. Create the necessary files in this folder to solve the exercise.

The function sayHi uses an external variable name. When the function runs, which value is it going to use?

function numberGenerator() {
  // Local “free” variable that ends up within the closure
  let num = 1;
  function checkNumber() {
    console.log(num);
  }
  num++;
  return checkNumber;
}

var number = numberGenerator();
number();
What will number() log to the console?
