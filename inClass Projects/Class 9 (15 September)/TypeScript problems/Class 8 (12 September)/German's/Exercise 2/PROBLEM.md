# Exercise #2: Closures
In `class-7-advance-javascript`, create a folder called `exercise-2`. Create the necessary files in this folder to solve the exercise.

**Aim:** Create a function that takes a string as input, capitalizes a letter if its ASCII code is even, and returns its lower case version if its ASCII code is odd.

### *Examples*
```
asciiCapitalize("to be or not to be!")    ➞    "To Be oR NoT To Be!"

asciiCapitalize("THE LITTLE MERMAID")    ➞    "THe LiTTLe meRmaiD"

asciiCapitalize("Oh what a beautiful morning.")    ➞    "oH wHaT a BeauTiFuL moRNiNg."
```
