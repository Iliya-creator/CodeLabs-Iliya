<!-- Exercise #2: Scopes - Will it show "John" or "Pete"? Part 2
In class-6, create a folder called exercise-2. Create the necessary files in this folder to solve the exercise.

The function makeWorker below makes another function and returns it. That new function can be called from somewhere else.

Will it have access to the outer variables from its creation place, or the invocation place, or both?

function makeWorker() {
  let name = "Pete";

  return function() {
    alert(name);
  };
}

let name = "John";

// create a function
let work = makeWorker();

// call it
work(); // what will it show?
Which value it will show? “Pete” or “John”? Before executing the code, think about this. To check your answer, execute this code.

You have solved this exercise when you understand the solution.
